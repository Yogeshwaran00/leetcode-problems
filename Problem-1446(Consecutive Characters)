Problem-1446(Consecutive Characters)

Description:
The power of the string is the maximum length of a non-empty substring that contains only one unique character.
Given a string s, return the power of s.

Example 1:
Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: 2
Explanation: The substring "ee" is of length 2 with the character 'e' only.

Example 2:
Input: s = "abbcccddddeeeeedcba"
Output: 5
Explanation: The substring "eeeee" is of length 5 with the character 'e' only.
 
Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 500
s consists of only lowercase English letters.

Solution:
class Solution {
public:
    int maxPower(string s) {
        int count=0;
        for(int i=0;i<s.size();i++){
            if(i+1<s.size() && s[i]==s[i+1]){
                int j=i;
                int scount=0;
                while(s[j]==s[j+1]){
                    scount++;
                    j++;
                }
                count=max(count,scount);
                i=j;
            }
        }
        return count+1;
    }
};
