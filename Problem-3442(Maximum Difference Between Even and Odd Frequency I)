Problem-3442(Maximum Difference Between Even and Odd Frequency I)

Description:
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.
Your task is to find the maximum difference diff = a1 - a2 between the frequency of characters a1 and a2 in the string such that:
a1 has an odd frequency in the string.
a2 has an even frequency in the string.
Return this maximum difference.

Example 1:
Input: s = "aaaaabbc"
Output: 3
Explanation:
The character 'a' has an odd frequency of 5, and 'b' has an even frequency of 2.
The maximum difference is 5 - 2 = 3.

Example 2:
Input: s = "abcabcab"
Output: 1
Explanation:
The character 'a' has an odd frequency of 3, and 'c' has an even frequency of 2.
The maximum difference is 3 - 2 = 1.
 
Constraints:
3 <= s.length <= 100
s consists only of lowercase English letters.
s contains at least one character with an odd frequency and one with an even frequency.

Solution:
public class Solution {
    public int MaxDifference(string s) {
        Dictionary<char,int>hold=new Dictionary<char,int>();
        foreach(char i in s){
            if(hold.ContainsKey(i)){
                hold[i]++;
            }
            else{
                hold[i]=1;
            }
        }
        int max=int.MinValue;
        int min=int.MaxValue;
        foreach(var i in hold){
            if(i.Value>max && i.Value%2!=0)max=i.Value;
            if(i.Value<min && i.Value%2==0)min=i.Value;
        }
        if(max==int.MinValue || min==int.MaxValue) {
            return 0; 
        }
        return max-min;
    }
}
