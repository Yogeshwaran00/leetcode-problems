Problem-1317(Convert Integer to the Sum of Two No-Zero Integers)

Description:
No-Zero integer is a positive integer that does not contain any 0 in its decimal representation.
Given an integer n, return a list of two integers [a, b] where:
a and b are No-Zero integers.
a + b = n
The test cases are generated so that there is at least one valid solution. If there are many valid solutions, you can return any of them.

Example 1:
Input: n = 2
Output: [1,1]
Explanation: Let a = 1 and b = 1.
Both a and b are no-zero integers, and a + b = 2 = n.

Example 2:
Input: n = 11
Output: [2,9]
Explanation: Let a = 2 and b = 9.
Both a and b are no-zero integers, and a + b = 11 = n.
Note that there are other valid answers as [8, 3] that can be accepted.
 
Constraints:
2 <= n <= 104

Solution:
public class Solution {
    public bool check(int n){
        while(n>0){
            if(n%10==0)return false;
            n/=10;
        }
        return true;
    }
    public int[] GetNoZeroIntegers(int n) {
        int[] hold = new int[2];
        int val=1;
        while(val<=n){
            int first=n-val;
            int second=val;
            if(check(first)==true && check(second)==true){
                hold[0]=first;
                hold[1]=second;
                break;
            }
            val++;
        }
        return hold;
    }
}
