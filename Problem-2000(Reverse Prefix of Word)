Problem-2000(Reverse Prefix of Word)

Soltuion:
Given a 0-indexed string word and a character ch, reverse the segment of word that starts at index 0 and ends at the index of the first occurrence of ch (inclusive). If the character ch does not exist in word, do nothing.
For example, if word = "abcdefd" and ch = "d", then you should reverse the segment that starts at 0 and ends at 3 (inclusive). The resulting string will be "dcbaefd".
Return the resulting string.

Example 1:
Input: word = "abcdefd", ch = "d"
Output: "dcbaefd"
Explanation: The first occurrence of "d" is at index 3. 
Reverse the part of word from 0 to 3 (inclusive), the resulting string is "dcbaefd".

Example 2:
Input: word = "xyxzxe", ch = "z"
Output: "zxyxxe"
Explanation: The first and only occurrence of "z" is at index 3.
Reverse the part of word from 0 to 3 (inclusive), the resulting string is "zxyxxe".

Example 3:
Input: word = "abcd", ch = "z"
Output: "abcd"
Explanation: "z" does not exist in word.
You should not do any reverse operation, the resulting string is "abcd".

Constraints:
1 <= word.length <= 250
word consists of lowercase English letters.
ch is a lowercase English letter.

Soltuion:
class Solution {
public:
    string reversePrefix(string word, char ch) {
        string temp;
        string temp2;
        for(int i=0;i<word.size();i++){
            if(word[i]==ch){
                temp=word.substr(0,i+1);
                temp2=word.substr(i+1);
                break;
            }
        }
        reverse(temp.begin(),temp.end());
        if(temp.size()==0 && temp2.size()==0)return word;
        return temp+temp2;
    }
};
