Constraints:
1 <= word.length <= 2 * 105
word consists of only lowercase and uppercase English letters.

Solution:
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfSpecialChars(string word) {
        vector<int>small(26,-1);
        vector<int>big(26,-1);
        for(int i=0;i<word.size();i++){
            if(word[i]>='a' && word[i]<='z'){
                    small[word[i]-'a']=i;
            }
            else{
                if(big[word[i]-'A']==-1){
                    big[word[i]-'A']=i;
                }
            }
        }
        int count=0;
        for(int i=0;i<26;i++){
            if(small[i]!=-1 && big[i]!=-1 && small[i]<big[i])count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
};
